	  G-Link is a generic link transport that replaces SMD.  It is used
	  within a System-on-Chip (SoC) for communication between both internal
	  processors and external peripherals.  The actual physical transport
	  is handled by transport plug-ins that can be individually enabled and

	  G-Link SMEM Native Transport is a G-Link Transport plug-in.  It allows
	  G-Link communication to remote entities through a shared memory
	  physical transport.  The nature of shared memory limits this G-Link
	  transport to only connecting with entities internal to the
	  System-on-Chip.
