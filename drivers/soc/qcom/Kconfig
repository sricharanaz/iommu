        help
          Say y here to enable GSBI support.  The GSBI provides control
          functions for connecting the underlying serial UART, SPI, and I2C
          devices to the output pins.

config QCOM_PM
	bool "Qualcomm Power Management"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM && !ARM64

	help
	  QCOM Platform specific power driver to manage cores and L2 low power
	  modes. It interface with various system drivers to put the cores in
	  low power modes.

	depends on HWSPINLOCK
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Manager.
	  The driver provides an interface to items in a heap shared among all
	  processors in a Qualcomm platform.

config QCOM_SMD
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver (SMD)"
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver
	  providing communication channels to remote processors in Qualcomm
	  platforms.

config QCOM_SMD_RPM
	tristate "Qualcomm Resource Power Manager (RPM) over SMD"
	depends on QCOM_SMD && OF
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Resource Power Manager system found in the Qualcomm 8974 based
	  devices.

	  This is required to access many regulators, clocks and bus
	  frequencies controlled by the RPM on these devices.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for the Qualcomm RPM as a

config MSM_GLINK
	bool "Generic Link (G-Link)"
	help
	  G-Link is a generic link transport that replaces SMD.  It is used
	  within a System-on-Chip (SoC) for communication between both internal
	  processors and external peripherals.  The actual physical transport
	  is handled by transport plug-ins that can be individually enabled and
	  configured separately.

config QCOM_SMP2P
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Point to Point support"
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	select QCOM_SMEM_STATE
	help
	  Say yes here to support the Qualcomm Shared Memory Point to Point
	  protocol.

config QCOM_SMSM
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory State Machine"
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	select QCOM_SMEM_STATE
	help
	  Say yes here to support the Qualcomm Shared Memory State Machine.
	  The state machine is represented by bits in shared memory.

config QCOM_WCNSS_CTRL
	tristate "Qualcomm WCNSS control driver"
	depends on QCOM_SMD
	help
	  Client driver for the WCNSS_CTRL SMD channel, used to download nv
	  firmware to a newly booted WCNSS chip.

config MSM_BUS_SCALING
	bool "Bus scaling driver"
	default n
	help
		This option enables bus scaling on MSM devices.  Bus scaling
		allows devices to request the clocks be set to rates sufficient
		for the active devices needs without keeping the clocks at max
		frequency when a slower speed is sufficient.

config MSM_BUSPM_DEV
	tristate "MSM Bus Performance Monitor Kernel Module"
	depends on MSM_BUS_SCALING
	default n
	help
	  This kernel module is used to mmap() hardware registers for the
	  performance monitors, counters, etc. The module can also be used to
	  allocate physical memory which is used by bus performance hardware to
	  dump performance data

config BUS_TOPOLOGY_ADHOC
	bool "ad-hoc bus scaling topology"
	default n
	help
		This option enables a driver that can handle adhoc bus topologies.
		Adhoc bus topology driver allows one to many connections and maintains
		directionality of connections by explicitly listing device connections
		thus avoiding illegal routes.

config MSM_GLINK_SMEM_NATIVE_XPRT

	bool "Generic Link (G-Link) SMEM Native Transport"
	help
	  G-Link SMEM Native Transport is a G-Link Transport plug-in.  It allows
	  G-Link communication to remote entities through a shared memory
	  physical transport.  The nature of shared memory limits this G-Link
	  transport to only connecting with entities internal to the
	  System-on-Chip.
