* MSM-ID

The qcom,msm-id entry specifies the MSM chipset and hardware revision.  It can
optionally be an array of these to indicate multiple hardware that use the same
device tree.  It is expected that the bootloader will use this information at
boot-up to decide which device tree to use when given multiple device trees,
some of which may not be compatible with the actual hardware.  It is the
bootloader's responsibility to pass the correct device tree to the kernel.

PROPERTIES

- qcom,msm-id:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array> (<chipset_id, rev_id> [, <c2, r2> ..])
	Definition:
		The "chipset_id" consists of three fields as below:

		bits 0-15  = The unique MSM chipset id.
		bits 16-31 = Reserved.  Should be 0

		chipset_id is an exact match value

		The "rev_id" is a chipset specific 32-bit id that represents
		the version of the chipset.

		The rev_id is a best match id.  The bootloader will look for
		the closest possible patch.

* BOARD-ID

The qcom,board-id entry specifies the board type and revision information.  It
can optionally be an array of these to indicate multiple boards that use the
same device tree.  It is expected that the bootloader will use this information
at boot-up to decide which device tree to use when given multiple device trees,
some of which may not be compatible with the actual hardware.  It is the
bootloader's responsibility to pass the correct device tree to the kernel.

PROPERTIES

- qcom,board-id:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array> (<board_id, subtype_id> [, <b2, s2> ..])
	Definition:
		The "board_id" consists of three fields as below:

		bits 31-24 = Unusued.
		bits 23-16 = Platform Version Major
		bits 15-8  = Platfrom Version Minor
		bits 7-0   = Platform Type

		Platform Type field is an exact match value.  The Platform
		Major/Minor field is a best match.  The bootloader will look
		for the closest possible match.

		The "subtype_id" is unique to a Platform Type/Chipset ID.  For
		a given Platform Type, there will typically only be a single
		board and the subtype_id will be 0.  However in some cases board
		variants may need to be distinquished by different subtype_id
		values.

		subtype_id is an exact match value.

EXAMPLE:
	qcom,board-id = <15 2>;
	qcom,msm-id = <0x1007e 0>;
