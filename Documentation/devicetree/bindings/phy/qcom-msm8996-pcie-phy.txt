Qualcomm msm8996 pcie PHY Controller
------------------------------------

pcie PHY nodes are defined to describe on-chip pcie Physical layer controllers.
Each pcie PHY controller should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible: compatible list, contains "qcom,msm8996-pcie-phy".
- reg: offset and length of the pcie PHY register set;
- #phy-cells: must be zero
- clocks: a list of phandles and clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry in
  clock-names.
- clock-names: must be "cfg" for phy config clock.

Example:
	pcie_phy: pcie-phy@1b400000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8996-pcie-phy";
		reg = <0x1b400000 0x200>;

		clocks = <&gcc pcie_PHY_CFG_CLK>;
		clock-names = "cfg";

		#phy-cells = <0>;
	};
