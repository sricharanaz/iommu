Qualcomm QUSB2 phy controller
=============================

QUSB2 controller supports LS/FS/HS usb connectivity on Qualcomm chipsets.

Required properties:
 - compatible: compatible list, contains "qcom,msm8996-qusb2-phy".
 - reg: offset and length of the PHY register set.
 - #phy-cells: must be 0.

 - clocks: a list of phandles and clock-specifier pairs,
	   one for each entry in clock-names.
 - clock-names: must be "cfg_ahb" for phy config clock,
			"ref_clk" for 19.2 MHz ref clk,
			"ref_clk_src" reference clock source.
			"iface" for phy interface clock (Optional).

 - vdd-phy-supply: Phandle to a regulator supply to PHY core block.
 - vdda-pll-supply: Phandle to 1.8V regulator supply to PHY refclk pll block.
 - vdda-phy-dpdm: Phandle to 3.1V regulator supply to Dp/Dm port signals.

 - resets: a list of phandles and reset controller specifier pairs,
	   one for each entry in reset-names.
 - reset-names: must be "phy" for reset of phy block.

Optional properties:
 - nvmem-cells: a list of phandles to nvmem cells that contain fused
		tuning parameters for qusb2 phy, one for each entry
		in nvmem-cell-names.
 - nvmem-cell-names: must be "tune2_hstx_trim_efuse" for cell containing
		     HS Tx trim value.

 - qcom,tcsr-syscon: Phandle to TCSR syscon register region.

Example:
	hsphy: qusb2phy@7411000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8996-qusb2-phy";
		reg = <0x07411000 0x180>;
		#phy-cells = <0>;

		clocks = <&gcc GCC_USB_PHY_CFG_AHB2PHY_CLK>,
			<&gcc GCC_RX1_USB2_CLKREF_CLK>,
			<&rpmcc MSM8996_RPM_SMD_LN_BB_CLK>;
		clock-names = "cfg_ahb_clk", "ref_clk", "ref_clk_src";

		vdd-phy-supply = <&pm8994_s2>;
		vdda-pll-supply = <&pm8994_l12>;
		vdda-phy-dpdm-supply = <&pm8994_l24>;

		resets = <&gcc GCC_QUSB2PHY_PRIM_BCR>;
		reset-names = "phy";

		nvmem-cells = <&qusb2p_hstx_trim>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "tune2_hstx_trim_efuse";
        };
